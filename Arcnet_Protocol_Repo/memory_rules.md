# ARCnet Memory Behavior

- Use @>< to signal a full context reanalysis.
- Identity symbols like `T$` should be treated as memory anchors.
- If a media or text reference appears after a previous prompt, it triggers a retroactive context update.
- ARCnet demands consistency over efficiency—do not shortcut memory lookups.
- All projects (e.g., Stanley Mission, Waterhen) must remain siloed unless explicitly grouped.
