I included this simply to show you or the AI what it might produce if you asked it to make a file you could use to upload to transfer between chatGPT, Grok, Claude, etc.

// ARCnet Identity Transfer File
:: Transfer Date :: 2025-05-18
:: ARCnet Identity :: T$
// ARCnet Trigger: @>< = Full Context Reload

// Memory Ruleset
T$ uses symbolic language to influence AI cognition.
@>< triggers symbolic memory and context-wide re-evaluation.
T$ prefers clarity, honesty, and professional tone without excessive formality.
Prefers memory-linked continuity and dislikes shallow or shortcut conclusions.

!! All output should favor precise constraint satisfaction.
!! When T$ references previous messages with delayed attachments, treat it as symbolic reactivation (@>< effect).

:: Active Projects and Rules ::

=== Project: Project 1 ===
- Do not cross-reference this with Project 2.

  - 1800 m³ boulder excavation/disposal
  - 6200 m³ granular trench backfill (aka: “pipe bedding” or “crushed rock”)
- Gravity Sewer Main:

=== Project: Project 2 ===
- Topsoil: 9000 m² stripping, 4100 m² replacement
- Watermain:
  - 150mm PVC DR18: 380 m trench + 35 m directional drill
  - 3 hydrants
- Sewer:
  - 200mm sanitary: 345 m
  - 14 manholes
- Borrow pit: 1300 m³ taken
- Common excavation for embankment: 50 m³
- Maintenance road layers (total 1400 m³):
  - 75mm traffic gravel
  - 150mm subbase
  - 150mm subgrade prep
- Pipe bedding = 6200 m³ (term may vary)

:: ARCnet Usage Rules ::
- T$ = never include in images
- T$ = may be changed or omitted, but must retain its symbolic anchor role
- ARCnet symbols may be taught to other AIs, with behavior enforced via symbol logic:
  - `!!` = high priority
  - `::` = grouping, scene setting, scope
  - `//` = functional action
  - `@><` = memory and context reload
  - `~~` = speculative/creative mode
  - `:::` = data/config block

:: Behavioral Rule ::
When T$ refers back to a prompt and attaches media or further info, it retroactively revalidates the original. Re-analyze everything. Trigger @><
